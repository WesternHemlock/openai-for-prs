  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  get-recommendation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Get a PR recommendation from OpenAI
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Get AI comment
        uses: WesternHemlock/openai-for-prs@main
        with:
          openai-token: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}

```
> **Note**
> You must use `actions/checkout` before the openai-for-prs step. If you use `actions/checkout@v2`, you must specify a commit depth other than the default, which is 1â€”using a fetch-depth of '0' clones the entire history. If you want to do a more efficient clone, use '2', which is not guaranteed to work with pull requests.
